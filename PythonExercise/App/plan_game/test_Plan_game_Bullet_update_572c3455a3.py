Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-vertex- using AI Type Vertex AI and AI Model code-bison-32k

 **Test Scenarios:**

**1. Bullet moves up the screen with the specified speed.**
   - Given a bullet with an initial position (x, y) and a speed of s pixels per second,
     when the update method is called with a time_passed of t seconds,
     then the bullet's position should be (x, y - s * t).

**2. Bullet is destroyed when it reaches the top of the screen.**
   - Given a bullet with an initial position (x, y) and a speed of s pixels per second,
     when the update method is called with a time_passed that causes the bullet's position to reach or exceed the top of the screen (y <= 0),
     then the bullet's position should be set to (-100, -100) and the destroyed flag should be set to True.

**3. Bullet is not destroyed when it is still within the screen.**
   - Given a bullet with an initial position (x, y) and a speed of s pixels per second,
     when the update method is called with a time_passed that causes the bullet's position to remain within the screen (y > 0),
     then the bullet's position should be updated according to its speed and the destroyed flag should remain False.

**4. Bullet is destroyed when it hits an enemy.**
   - Given a bullet with an initial position (x, y) and a speed of s pixels per second,
     and an enemy with a position (e_x, e_y) and a size (e_width, e_height),
     when the update method is called with a time_passed that causes the bullet's position to intersect with the enemy's bounding box,
     then the bullet's position should be set to (-100, -100) and the destroyed flag should be set to True.

**5. Bullet is not destroyed when it misses an enemy.**
   - Given a bullet with an initial position (x, y) and a speed of s pixels per second,
     and an enemy with a position (e_x, e_y) and a size (e_width, e_height),
     when the update method is called with a time_passed that causes the bullet's position to miss the enemy's bounding box,
     then the bullet's position should be updated according to its speed and the destroyed flag should remain False.
