"""
Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-openai using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

Test Scenario 1:
Name: Validate crash detection when the plane and enemy are not in collision.
Input: A plane and an enemy in positions where they are not colliding.
Expected Outcome: The plane's start_destroy attribute should remain False.

Test Scenario 2:
Name: Validate crash detection when the plane and enemy are in collision.
Input: A plane and an enemy in positions where they are colliding.
Expected Outcome: The plane's start_destroy attribute should be set to True.

Test Scenario 3:
Name: Validate crash detection when the plane and multiple enemies are in play, none of which collide with the plane.
Input: A plane and multiple enemies in positions where none are colliding with the plane.
Expected Outcome: The plane's start_destroy attribute should remain False.

Test Scenario 4:
Name: Validate crash detection when the plane and multiple enemies are in play, at least one of which collides with the plane.
Input: A plane and multiple enemies in positions where at least one enemy is colliding with the plane.
Expected Outcome: The plane's start_destroy attribute should be set to True.

Test Scenario 5:
Name: Validate crash detection when the plane and enemy are in collision, but the crash size is larger than the enemy size.
Input: A plane and an enemy in positions where they are colliding, with the crash size larger than the enemy size.
Expected Outcome: The plane's start_destroy attribute should remain False.

Test Scenario 6:
Name: Validate crash detection when the plane and enemy are in collision, but the crash size is smaller than the enemy size.
Input: A plane and an enemy in positions where they are colliding, with the crash size smaller than the enemy size.
Expected Outcome: The plane's start_destroy attribute should be set to True.

Test Scenario 7:
Name: Validate crash detection when no crash size is specified.
Input: A plane and an enemy in positions where they are colliding, with no crash size specified.
Expected Outcome: The plane's start_destroy attribute should be set to True, as the crash size should default to 10% of the plane's width.
