Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-openai using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Scenario: Verify the function with minimum valid time_passed and destroy_time
   - Ensure the function works correctly when time_passed is 0 and destroy_time is 200.
   - Check if the destroy_image_position is incremented correctly.

2. Scenario: Verify the function with maximum valid time_passed and destroy_time
   - Ensure the function works correctly when time_passed is 200 and destroy_time is 200.
   - Check if the destroy_image_position is incremented correctly.

3. Scenario: Verify destroy_image_position increment when time_passed is equal to destroy_time/4
   - Ensure that the destroy_image_position increments by one when time_passed is equal to destroy_time/4.

4. Scenario: Verify destroy_image_position increment when time_passed is greater than destroy_time/4
   - Ensure that the destroy_image_position increments by one when time_passed is greater than destroy_time/4.

5. Scenario: Verify the function when destroy_image_position is equal to 4
   - When destroy_image_position equals 4, the function should set self.destroyed to True.

6. Scenario: Verify the function when destroy_image_position is greater than 4
   - When destroy_image_position is greater than 4, the function should set self.destroyed to True.

7. Scenario: Verify that the destroy animation images load correctly
   - Ensure that the destroy animation images load correctly when called.

8. Scenario: Verify that the function resets time_passed correctly
   - Ensure that time_passed is reset to 0 after an image is loaded.

9. Scenario: Verify that the function increments time_passed correctly
   - Ensure that time_passed is incremented by the passed value when an image is not loaded. 

10. Scenario: Verify the function when destroy_time is less than time_passed
    - Ensure that the function handles the case where destroy_time is less than time_passed correctly. 

11. Scenario: Verify the function when time_passed is negative
    - Ensure that the function handles the case where time_passed is negative correctly. 

12. Scenario: Verify the function when destroy_time is negative
    - Ensure that the function handles the case where destroy_time is negative correctly.
