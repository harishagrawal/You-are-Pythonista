Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-vertex- using AI Type Vertex AI and AI Model code-bison-32k

 **Test Scenarios:**

**1. Valid Scenario - Animation Display:**
   - **Input:**
     - `time_passed` = 100 (ms)
     - `destroy_time` = 200 (ms)
     - `destroy_image_position` = 1
   - **Expected Output:**
     - The animation should display the second image of the self-destruct sequence.
     - `time_passed` should be reset to 0.
     - `destroy_image_position` should increment to 2.

**2. Animation Completion Scenario:**
   - **Input:**
     - `time_passed` = 100 (ms)
     - `destroy_time` = 200 (ms)
     - `destroy_image_position` = 4
   - **Expected Output:**
     - The animation should be marked as completed by setting `destroyed` to `True`.

**3. Time-Based Image Switching Scenario:**
   - **Input:**
     - `time_passed` = 50 (ms)
     - `destroy_time` = 200 (ms)
     - `destroy_image_position` = 1
   - **Expected Output:**
     - The image should not change since the time passed is less than `destroy_time / 4`.
     - `time_passed` should be updated to 50 (ms).

**4. Time-Based Animation Completion Scenario:**
   - **Input:**
     - `time_passed` = 250 (ms)
     - `destroy_time` = 200 (ms)
     - `destroy_image_position` = 3
   - **Expected Output:**
     - The animation should display the fourth image of the self-destruct sequence.
     - `time_passed` should be reset to 0.
     - `destroy_image_position` should increment to 4.
     - `destroyed` should be set to `True` as the animation is complete.

**5. Animation Not Started Scenario:**
   - **Input:**
     - `time_passed` = 0 (ms)
     - `destroy_time` = 200 (ms)
     - `destroy_image_position` = 0
   - **Expected Output:**
     - The image should not change since the animation has not started.
     - `time_passed` should remain at 0.
     - `destroy_image_position` should remain at 0.
