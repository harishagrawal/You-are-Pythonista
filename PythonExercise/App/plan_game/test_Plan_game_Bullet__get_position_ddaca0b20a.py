Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-openai using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Scenario: Validate output when the 'plan' object has a position at origin.
   - Given that the 'plan' object has a position at (0,0)
   - When the `_get_position` function is called with the 'plan' object
   - Then the function should return the correct bullet position based on the bullet and plan sizes.

2. Scenario: Validate output when the 'plan' object has a position other than origin.
   - Given that the 'plan' object has a position at any point other than (0,0)
   - When the `_get_position` function is called with the 'plan' object
   - Then the function should return the correct bullet position based on the bullet and plan sizes and the plan's position.

3. Scenario: Validate output when the 'plan' object has a negative position.
   - Given that the 'plan' object has a negative position
   - When the `_get_position` function is called with the 'plan' object
   - Then the function should return the correct bullet position based on the bullet and plan sizes and the plan's position.

4. Scenario: Validate output when the 'plan' object has a large position values.
   - Given that the 'plan' object has large position values
   - When the `_get_position` function is called with the 'plan' object
   - Then the function should return the correct bullet position based on the bullet and plan sizes and the plan's position.

5. Scenario: Validate output when the 'bullet_size' is greater than 'plan_width'.
   - Given that the 'bullet_size' is greater than 'plan_width'
   - When the `_get_position` function is called with the 'plan' object
   - Then the function should return the correct bullet position based on the bullet and plan sizes and the plan's position.

6. Scenario: Validate output when the 'bullet_size' is less than 'plan_width'.
   - Given that the 'bullet_size' is less than 'plan_width'
   - When the `_get_position` function is called with the 'plan' object
   - Then the function should return the correct bullet position based on the bullet and plan sizes and the plan's position. 

7. Scenario: Validate output when the 'bullet_size' is equal to 'plan_width'.
   - Given that the 'bullet_size' is equal to 'plan_width'
   - When the `_get_position` function is called with the 'plan' object
   - Then the function should return the correct bullet position based on the bullet and plan sizes and the plan's position.
