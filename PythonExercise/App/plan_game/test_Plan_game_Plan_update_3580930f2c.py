# ********RoostGPT********
"""
Test generated by RoostGPT for test py-vertex- using AI Type Vertex AI and AI Model code-bison-32k

 **Test Scenarios:**

**1. Boundary Testing:**
- Test the function when the plane is at the leftmost boundary and tries to move left.
- Test the function when the plane is at the rightmost boundary and tries to move right.
- Test the function when the plane is at the topmost boundary and tries to move up.
- Test the function when the plane is at the bottommost boundary and tries to move down.

**2. Functional Testing:**
- Test the function when the plane is in the middle of the screen and moves in each direction.
- Test the function when the plane is moving in one direction and then changes direction.
- Test the function when the plane is moving in one direction and then stops moving.

**3. Negative Testing:**
- Test the function when the direction is not a valid integer.
- Test the function when the direction is a negative integer.
- Test the function when the direction is a float.
- Test the function when the direction is a string.
